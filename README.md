# Guessing_missing_letters_using_ML
I have trained Seq2Seq and LSTM models to guess the missing letters from a word.

  When a word is given eg: app_e whit missing letter.  the model will output the missing letter eg: app_e --> l.

  The model is only trained with limited dataset. For further training I've give codes which you can use.
